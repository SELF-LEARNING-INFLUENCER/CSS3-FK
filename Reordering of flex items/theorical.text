Reordering of flex items:

In addition to altering the flow within a flex container, you can also 
change the order in which individual flex items are displayed using the order property. 
This property accepts positive or negative integer as value. By default, all flex items 
are displayed and laid out in the same order as they appear in the HTML markup as the 
default value of order is 0.
